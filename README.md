Licensing-officer-admin web application is developed with php.

Facial recognization application was made by flutter to make it available for both iOS and android. Minimum SDK version is 21 and maximum version is 28.
Due to absense of .dart-tools in facial_recognization, you will get some error. We are sorry because .dart-tools file are not eligible to upload in github. We request you to click "Debuge anyway" from Visual Studio Code when you run it. It will autometically create a .dart-tools file and also fix all the erors. Then you will get the application.
